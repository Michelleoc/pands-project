Research on Fisher's Iris data set 

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis

Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers.

This discriminant function performed well in discriminating between these species, except some overlap between Iris versicolor and Iris virginica. 
The Iris setosa is noticeably different from the other two species.

3 species of Iris where used in the dataset (50 samplues of each species was used)
    1.Iris setosa
    2.Iris Virginica
    3.Iris Veriscolor

There are 4 variables in the Iris dataset
    1.Length of sepals (cm)
    2.Width of sepals (cm)
    3.Length of petals (cm)
    4.Width of petals (cm)

These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.

The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

Information about the original paper and usages of the dataset can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository -- Iris Data Set.

The Iris dataset consists of 50 samples each of three difference species of the iris flower: setosa, vericolor and virginica. 

Each row is an observation (also known as: sample, example, instance, record)
Each column is a feature (also known as: predictor, attribute, independent variable, input, regressor, covariate)
