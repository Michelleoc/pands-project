Research on Fisher's Iris data set 

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis

Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers.

This discriminant function performed well in discriminating between these species, except some overlap between Iris versicolor and Iris virginica. 
The Iris setosa is noticeably different from the other two species.
